<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![AEXP AI][GUI (User Interface)]](https://r.resimlink.com/DM1OQgpUG2.png?v=7149395e7f67f5db90ca5c2915dc80c5)

Unlike other LLMs, AEXP AI, which you can train on your own data, offers you a personal artificial intelligence experience!

Here's why:
* You can chat and joke with him!
* You can teach him something new!
* And most importantly, you can train a chatbot from scratch with your personal database! :smile:

Of course, this project is not exactly a chatbot, but being able to train it on your own data really gives you an advantage.
